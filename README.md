# Gameplay Analysis

#### Hi! This is the final project I did on my advanced R programming class. The detail is down below.

## Dataset

I got the dataset from Kaggle (an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners). 

One is about used cars price, the other is about income classification.

I did visualization features in different level players using radar charts.

## Models

**1. LDA**
**2. QDA**
**3. Decision Tree**

**5. SVM**

## Dimesion Reduction

I combined 7 levels into 3 to get better result.
